## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Bright orange (#FF8C00), evokes the feeling of fire and enthusiasm.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) provides contrast and modern feel.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFD700), highlight key elements and calls to action.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif for a modern and tech-oriented feel, used for both headings and body text.
- Use icons in the style of the fire logo. Specifically, code snippets should be enclosed in angle bracket style elements (but in orange).
- Modern layout with clear sections for courses, tutorials, and the community forum. Promote clarity and scannability through plenty of whitespace.
- Subtle animations on button hover and transitions between pages to improve user experience.
